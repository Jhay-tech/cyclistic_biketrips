## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success

I was asked to complete this case study after the completion of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. In this case study, I work with a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic. The objective is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. I was assigned to spot differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

I used Cyclistic historical trip data to determine trends or relationships, and theorise what was causing them. After then, I develop an action plan based on those findings.
