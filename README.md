## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success

Ater the completion of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, I was asked to complete this case study. In this case study, I work with a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic. The objective is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. I was assigned to spot differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

I used Cyclistic historical trip data to determine trends or relationships, and theorise what was causing them. After then, I develop an action plan based on those findings. 

### Introduction 
Cyclistic is a bike-share company with two categories of customers; casual riders (customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members (Customers who purchase annual memberships).
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
