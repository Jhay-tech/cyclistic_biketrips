## Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success

Ater the completion of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera, I was asked to complete this case study. In this case study, I work with a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic. The objective is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. I was assigned to spot differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. 

I used Cyclistic historical trip data to determine trends or relationships, and theorise what was causing them. After then, I develop an action plan based on those findings. 

### Introduction 
Cyclistic is a bike-share company with two categories of customers; casual riders (customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and annual members (Customers who purchase annual memberships).
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oﬀering. Since then, the program has grown to a ﬂeet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

**Characters and teams:**
> 1. **Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.
> 2. **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and my manager.
> 3. **Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
> 4. **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

### ASK
**Problem Explanation** <br>
Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. There are 3 questions that will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? <br>
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? <br>
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? <br>

For this project, the director of marketing assigned me to answer the first question (How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?).

**Business Task:** 
Analyse fictional company (Cyclistic) trip data to spot differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
